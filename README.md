# Early Flood Detection and Alert System 🌊

This project is a **Next.js** and **Machine Learning** powered early warning system designed to predict flood risks in real-time for flood-prone regions like Sangli, Maharashtra. It helps authorities and residents proactively take preventive actions by providing accurate flood probability predictions through an interactive dashboard.

## ✨ Project Overview

Flooding is a recurring disaster in the Sangli region, causing severe damages.  
Our system addresses this by:

- Integrating **real-time sensor data** with **Machine Learning (ML)** models.
- Predicting flood probabilities based on key environmental factors: rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and river water levels.
- Displaying results using **charts, graphs, and a map-based interface**.
- Empowering authorities and the public to act before disaster strikes.

## 📈 Features

- 🔹 **Accurate Real-Time Flood Predictions**: Analyze live sensor data and environmental parameters for immediate flood risk assessment.
- 🔹 **Risk Level Classification**: Predict and classify flood risk into Low, Medium, or High categories with probability scores.
- 🔹 **Dynamic Map Visualization**: Display flood-prone regions interactively using real-time mapping tools.
- 🔹 **Intuitive Data Representation**: Visualize trends and predictions through interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards for easy interpretation.
- 🔹 **Automated Alert System**: Send instant flood alerts via SMS and email notifications; integrate deep learning models for enhanced predictive accuracy.


## 🌟 Objectives

- Predict flood risks using trained ML models.
- Visualize predictions interactively via a web dashboard.
- Enable real-time decision-making to minimize flood impacts.
- Plan for future enhancements like live alerts (SMS, email) and deep learning model integration.
